###Description

The Angular framework is deep. There is no single way to do things, so there is no one way to teach the framework. However, this course provides just the right mixture of basic coding knowledge and structure to get a new Angular programmer up to speed. I don't recommend it for someone who is new to Javascript (closures? anonymous functions? What is this sorcery?), but for someone who has used Javascript and a little JQuery, Angular is the next logical step and this course makes it easy to get started.
